Elixirs
=======
Template for building new docker base images with Elixir.
Uses `matchoffice/rubies` as base image.

Edit `Dockerfile`, docker build and push your new versions to Docker Hub as you see fit. Naming convention is `matchoffice/elixirs:1.3.3`

Notes:

- ruby is used to provide support of building slim templates in elixir/phoenix apps
- nodejs is installed from official source
